Chase has his current GPA, social points, study hours, and the amount of stress he's under. Now it's time to choose a new course option: A, B, C, with it being easiest to hardest (Aâ†’C), using if,elif, and else to determine this, along with comparison operators to check if they match the course letter and certain outcomes based on GPA. This will affect your stress levels and study hours. You have also chosen classes to pick from, where you get to pick one to focus on your study options. This will impact your social points and study hours, and some courses may have specific study options that are affected by your course options or study hours. This is used with the operators from last time, along with membership operators and identity operators, ensuring the class options in the list and identity to see if study hours ever equal your social hours. This will result in a customized experience with 6+ options for a fun and interactive experience.
